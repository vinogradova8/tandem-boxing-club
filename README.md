This project is a website for a boxing school. The main task of the site is to encourage new students and find sponsors for the development of the school.

<h4>There are 5 main sections on the website:</h4>
<p>Homepage</p>
<p>Team</p>
<p>Frequently asked questions</p>
<p>Gallery</p>
<p>Support</p>

<h4>Technologies that were used:</h4>
<p>HTML - was used to build semantically correct pages.</p>
<p>SCSS - was used for styling.</p>
<p>React - is a library I choose for this project because it provides a robust and efficient way to build complex user interfaces with reusable components.</p>
<p>TypeScript - helped me to avoid errors connected with variables types and make JavaScript more predictable.
</p>
<p>i18next - a JavaScript library that I used to make our website multilingual. 
</p>
<p>Swiper - a library I used to to create the slider. 
</p>
